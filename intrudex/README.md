This plugin provides an interface to generate Intruder payload positions based on results from a regex. This can be helpful when the default Intruder auto-marker functionality is too broad, or the request is too large, or you just need specific control over what gets targeted.

Requires Jython so make sure you have that configured in Burp.

**Status**: Alpha. Needs some UI work and currently has placeholders for the host, port, and SSL option when sending to Intruder. Otherwise functional.
