Just what it sounds like.

## stringtrim
This plugin provides a payload generator for Intruder which will trim off one character at a time from the right side of a given position.

## intrudex
**Status**: Alpha. Needs some UI work and currently has placeholders for the host, port, and SSL option when sending to Intruder. Otherwise functional.

Styled *IntRudeX*, it is an interface to generate Intruder payload positions based on results from a regex. This can be helpful when the default Intruder auto-marker functionality is too broad, or the request is too large, or you just need specific control over what gets targeted.
